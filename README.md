# Practical Advanced Kotlin in Practice — The repository
This repo contains the code for my "Practical Advanced Kotlin in Practice" workshop with all the excercises.
In order to complete these excercises, you need to have a recent version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) with an up-to-date Kotlin plugin.

You will be able to find the accompanying slides here, once they get published. Link pending, for now.

## How to do the workshop

Clone the repository on your machine, import the project in the IDE, and start looking at the excercises you can find in
[`src/main/kotlin`](src/main/kotlin).
Excercises are divided in folders/packages; generally, excercises consist of one or more source files with `TODO()`s
that have to be filled in to make the corresponding tests pass.
Tests for each excercise are located in the same package and can be found in the corresponding folders in
[`src/test/kotlin`](src/test/kotlin).

You can find the accompanying slide deck here: [https://go.sebastiano.dev/kotlin-workshop-2022](https://go.sebastiano.dev/kotlin-workshop-2022)

**Protip!** You can navigate to a file's tests by pressing <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> on Mac,
or <kbd>^ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> on Windows and Linux. More details
